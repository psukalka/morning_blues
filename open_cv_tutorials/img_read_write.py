"""
Reading and writing an image with Open CV.
Numpy is an important library for most opencv operations. Deep understanding of it will be helpful.

*) Even if the image path is wrong, it wonâ€™t throw any error, but print img will give you None
*) Color image loaded by OpenCV is in BGR mode while by matplotlib is in RGB mode.

'''
cv2.IMREAD_COLOR : Loads a color image. Any transparency of image will be neglected. It is the default flag.
cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE : Loads image in grayscale mode
cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED : Loads image as such including alpha channel

Instead of these three flags, you can simply pass integers 1, 0 or -1 respectively.
